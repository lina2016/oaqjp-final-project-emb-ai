You will also be required to perform various tasks and submit your results with specific nomenclature.

## Emotion Detection
Emotion detection goes beyond sentiment analysis by extracting more nuanced emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and more from text statements. This capability is essential for AI-based recommendation systems, chatbots, and various other applications. In this project, we will harness the power of Watson AI to create an emotion detection application.
